    <p class="blogText">Hello, I have yet to break my habit of writing here, which I'm glad about, since I'm not good 
        <b>yet</b> at keeping such promises. So, today, I had Lectures at an IT-School, it's pretty nice there.
        I also like the humour the teachers bring with them, they're more likeable than your average teacher.
        I remember mentioning being on Self-Improvement yesterday. How did I get on it? I, believe it or not,
        was trying to get on "NoFap" for the promoted purposes on youtube. Eventually, I stumbled upon a Channel,
        called <a id="icecold_jt" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ICEcoldJT"><b>ICEcold JT</b></a>. He uploaded a good, informative and pleasing video about NoFap. So I thought, "Why shouldn't
        I check him out?". I took a liking to his Channel almost immedeately, because of how well I could relate to him.
        And it was obvious, I wasn't the only one who felt in a similar way as JT (I'm going to call him JT from now on)
        , because his numbers went up, and we all started our journey of hollistic Self-Improvement. Like with every com
        munity, you get to know other people uploading the same stuff because of the recommendations, and for me that
        person was <a id="Hamza" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Hamza97"><b>Hamza</b></a>. And yeah, that's how I
        started thinking: "If everyone did, why can't I?". And exactly that, is what I needed. I was depressed and
        didn't know what to do with my life, except for watching Anime (Japanese Cartoons) and spending my time
        with low-quality people who would drag me down. Now I know, this might not sound like a Blog, but that's 
        how it progresses for me. I like to talk about my past and experiences (there is still a lot to come).
        So wish me luck with my life and future. I also think, there are three quotes that have grown onto me,
        and I think about  them every-single-day.
        <ol>
            <li>"It is a shame, for a man to grow old, without knowing the strength and beauty of which his body is capable" -Socrates</li>
            <li>"Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it" -Hamza</li>
            <li>"Keep moving forward, just like Eren Yaeger" -ICEcold JT</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="blogText">I just remembered that I still have a lot of Stuff to do, so that was it for today. Thanks for dropping by!</p></p>
