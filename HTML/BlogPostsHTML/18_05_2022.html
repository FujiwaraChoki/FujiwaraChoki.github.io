        Today's my first day posting a blog on here. I really hope I won't break this habit<br />
        since it's really easy to do so. You know, I've been on Self-Imporvement for a couple Months, and I realized,<br />
        nothing worth having is easy to get. Back to my point, building good habits is hard. But abolishing bad habits<br />
        is even <b>harder</b>.
        By the way, since you still know pretty much nothing about me, I'm a High Schooler in Switzerland, and after<br />
        taking a Class in HTML and CSS, decided to run my own Blog. I'm addicted to Hardstyle Songs,<br />
        I can only encourage you to listen to it, and give my
        <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdM8Q4WosB7lIW5NKzXqEPFGpE_Srzve5" target="_blank">playlist a chance</a>.
        Now, you might've noticed a <b>pattern</b>. <br />In a lot of Videos you'll read/hear the name "Zyzz".
        Who is he? What does he do? Why is he in there? Well you see, first of all, <br />he's an absolute legend, which means
        he's unfortunately dead (He died in 2011). He's my idol. I'd even go as far as saying, he's my savior.<br />
        The one who saved, protected me, from the wickedness of this modern day and age. Gave me a reason, to be a man <br />
        and not to be the one who complains and whines because the world is unfair... He taught me, you could <br />
        become anyone you want as long you work hard and believe in yourself. I know, Clich√©. But it works better than expected.
        <br/ > If you want to, you can learn more about him and join the movement against this modern world, by clicking this
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDqk6KJVyP8&feature=youtu.be" title="Zyzz's Life And Effect on Young Men." target="_blank">link,</a>
        or by clicking on his image <br />on the homepage. I could go on and on about him and don't even get me started with this
        beautiful, <br />motivating and supporting community (They are absolutely amazing). But I think for one Post,
        <br />that's enough. I'd really like to continue but I've still got some assignments left.</p>
