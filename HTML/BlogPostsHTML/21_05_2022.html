        Hey guys. Missed yesterday's Blog post, since I couldn't access my computer and I forgot it anyways. I will 
        try to make sure this doesn't happen again. Today I had a lot of fun. Especially, going out for once, with my family and
        enjoying life. I rarely get to do that. And another thing I'm happy about is that today, I joined a new discord server
        about Self-Improvement, it's from a guy called Ronzo. Amazing Guy, no doubt he's trying to change us all
        and improve himself on the way too. I respect him based on the fact alone how he's changed his physique in only <b>one year.</b>
        Please, if you have nothing else to do right now, check him out! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLR0NqUc4m6zBL0p8WxN-lw"
        >Ronzo</a> and his <a href="https://discord.gg/NCUxsKFJ">discord</a> server.
        Also if you're looking for any Coaching or similar things, his Patreon is the way to go, since, and I quote:
        "I will treat you as a human, and not a transaction." as Ronzo mentioned in the today-uploaded video.
        Now back to topic, wait, is there even a topic? Anyways, I've bought this book called "12 Rules for Life" by
        Jordan B. Peterson, but I was too lazy to read even 10 pages in it yet. But Ronzo's Video today brought me back 
        to reality. Like a motivation boost. I hope you understand why I like to watch such Videos as <b>"Reject Modernity, 
        Embrace Masculinity"</b>. The only thing I didn't like about today, was the food I ate. It was going pretty much
         into the direction of Instant-Gratification, and I felt bad afterwards, like really. If you're wondering what could've 
         been so bad, for me to say this. It was Burger Kind.. AND Pizza. Your average Person wouldn't find this that bad. 
         But I've been on a diet for 1 month and was starting to see some results. Hence, I used my progress as an excuse to 
         do the bad habits. I hope I don't make the same mistake again. Also, if anyone reading this, also wants to share 
         his progress on this site, please feel free to contact me through E-Mail (You'll find it on the Homepage.)
         I think that was enough for today, again I'm disappointed by myself I couldn't even keep a promise for 3 days.
         However, what would I have to improve, if I didn't mess up, right?
